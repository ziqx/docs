## 1. What Is ZAuth?

ZAuth works as an OAuth-based authentication system similar to other identity providers (e.g., Google OAuth).  
It handles user authentication, session management, and user data securely on your behalf.

By enabling ZAuth, your app can support multiple sign-in methods instantly ‚Äî with just one integration.

## 2. Enable ZAuth for Your App

1. Go to your **App** in the dashboard.
2. Open the **ZAuth** section.
3. Click **Enable ZAuth**.
4. You‚Äôll get a **Key** for authentication requests.
5. Set your **Development URL** and **Production URL**.

ZAuth will use these URLs to redirect users back to your app after successful authentication, based on the environment you‚Äôre running.

## 3. How It Works

1. In your app, call the provided **ZAuth SDK function** (e.g., `zauth.signIn()`).
2. The user will be redirected to the **ZAuth authentication page**.
3. After successful authentication, ZAuth will redirect the user back to your configured **Dev** or **Prod** URL.
4. The redirect will include an **authorization token**, which can be used to verify and fetch user details from your backend.

This keeps your app secure while minimizing development time.

## 4. Manage Users

You can view and manage all users of your App directly in the dashboard under the **Users** section.  
ZAuth handles user creation, verification, and authentication automatically.

---

## 5. Supported Authentication Methods

ZAuth supports multiple sign-in methods out of the box:

- **Google Sign-In**
- **Email + OTP**
- **Email + Password**
- **WhatsApp Login** (Coming Soon)
- _(More methods will be added over time.)_

This flexibility allows you to provide your users with a seamless login experience suited to your app‚Äôs audience.
