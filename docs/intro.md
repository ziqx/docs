# Introduction

# Welcome to ZIQX Docs

ZIQX is a developer-first platform designed to simplify and accelerate how you build, host, and scale digital products.  
It brings together a suite of modular systems — each crafted to handle complex infrastructure and logic behind the scenes, so you can focus purely on creation.

---

## 🚀 What Is ZIQX?

ZIQX is more than just a set of APIs — it’s a complete ecosystem built for developers, startups, and digital creators.  
Every tool under ZIQX is designed to work independently yet integrate seamlessly with the others.

From authentication and storage to future tools like payments, analytics, and content delivery — ZIQX provides everything your apps need, under one unified framework.

---

## 🧩 Core Systems

ZIQX currently offers two core systems, with more coming soon:

### 1. **ZAuth**

ZAuth is ZIQX’s authentication system.  
It allows developers to add secure and modern login flows to their apps without building an auth backend.

- OAuth-based authentication flow
- Supports Google, Email+OTP, Password, and WhatsApp login
- Environment-aware redirects (Dev & Prod URLs)
- Built-in user management dashboard

ZAuth is fast, secure, and fully managed — you just enable it for your app and integrate a simple SDK call.

### 2. **Drive**

Drive is ZIQX’s secure file storage and management system.  
It offers an efficient and scalable way to store, retrieve, and manage your app’s assets — from images to documents — with minimal setup.

- Each App can have multiple Drives
- Files are uploaded via signed URLs for security
- Flexible storage plans by zone and size
- Simple pricing based on storage and bandwidth

Drive is the perfect storage companion for your applications — reliable, developer-friendly, and built for scale.

## 🧠 The ZIQX Philosophy

ZIQX is built on three principles:

- **Simplicity:** Tools that work out of the box with minimal configuration.
- **Scalability:** Each system is designed to grow with your product.
- **Interoperability:** Every ZIQX module connects naturally with others.

Whether you’re building a small app or a large-scale platform, ZIQX provides the core infrastructure you can rely on — authentication, storage, and beyond.

## ⚙️ What’s Next

ZIQX is expanding.  
Upcoming systems will include:

- **ZPay** — Unified payment gateway and billing management
- **ZEdge** — Global CDN and content acceleration
- **ZAnalytics** — Real-time performance and usage tracking
- **ZMail** — Transactional and marketing email delivery

Each module will be linked through your **Apps**, keeping your ecosystem centralized, secure, and efficient.
