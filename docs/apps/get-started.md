# Introduction

Apps are the core foundation of your workspace. Everything in your environment—such as Drives, Auth, and other upcoming tools—will be linked to an App.  
Think of an App as a container or project space where you manage all related resources.

---

## 1. What Is an App?

An **App** represents your project or product within the platform.  
Each App can have multiple Drives attached to it, use our authentication system, and later integrate with additional tools and services that we’ll introduce.

Apps help keep your projects organized and isolated, giving you flexibility and control over resources, access, and billing.

## 2. Enable Developer Tools

Before you can create Apps, you must enable Developer Tools in your dashboard.

1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Locate **Developer Tools**.
3. Toggle it **ON**.

Once enabled, you’ll see the **Apps** section in your dashboard.

## 3. Create an App

1. Go to the **Apps** section in your dashboard.
2. Click **Create App**.
3. Enter the **App Name** and **App Type**.
4. Click **Create** to finalize it.

After creation, your App will appear in the dashboard, ready for Drives and other linked services.

# Available Tools

## 1. Drive

A Drive is a secure cloud storage unit attached to an App.
It’s where you store, manage, and access your application’s files — such as images, videos, documents, or any other digital assets.

Each Drive is created under a specific App and comes with its own configuration, storage zone, and pricing plan.
This separation allows you to organize resources for each project independently — with isolated usage tracking, billing, and access controls.

### Key characteristics:

- Each App can have multiple Drives.
- Each Drive has its own storage zone and plan.
- Files are uploaded via signed URLs for security.
- A Drive secret is used to generate signed URLs securely.

## 5. ZAuth

ZAuth is a unified authentication system that lets you add secure, production-grade login features to your apps with just **one integration**.

It’s built to handle everything — from OAuth flows to user management — so you can focus on building your product, not managing sign-ins.

With ZAuth, you can enable authentication for any app in seconds, configure development and production environments, and instantly offer multiple login methods like **Google, Email + OTP, Email + Password, or WhatsApp.**

ZAuth securely redirects users to your app after login and provides you with verified user details, tokens, and access controls — all managed from your dashboard.

> Build fast. Stay secure. Authenticate with ZAuth.

## Future Integrations

We’ll be adding more features soon, including tools and services that can be linked directly to your Apps — all under one unified environment.
