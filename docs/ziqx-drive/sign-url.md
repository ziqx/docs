# Generate Signed URL

To securely upload files to your Drive, you first need to generate a signed URL. This page explains the process.

## 1. Generate Signed URL

Send a **GET** request to:

```
https://ziqx.cc/api/drive/sign-url
```

### Required Headers

- `x-drive-key`: Your Drive ID
- `x-drive-secret`: Your secret

> **Tip:** You can generate the secret in your dashboard. For security, periodically regenerate your secret.

### Response

A successful request will return:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Success",
  "url": "https://upload.drive.ziqx.net/?key=encrypted_upload_key"
}
```

The `url` provided is the signed URL to which your file will be uploaded.

## 2. Upload File

1. Send a **POST** request to the `upload_url` obtained above.
2. Use **multipart/form-data** as the request body.

### Response

Upon successful upload, the response will return the file name. This file name can then be saved in your database for reference.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "File uploaded successfully",
  "filename": "filename.jpg",
  "driveid": "your-drive-id"
}
```

## 3. Summary

- Generate a signed URL using your Drive key and secret.
- Upload files securely via POST request to the signed URL.
- Save the returned file name for future use.

Following this process ensures secure and efficient file uploads to your Drive.
